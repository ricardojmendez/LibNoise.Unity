## About

[LibNoise](http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/) was originally created by
Jason Bevins. The library was later ported to Xna by [Marc André Ueberall](http://www.big-black-block.com/#home), and moved to Unity by Tim Speltz. Speltz’s  original development forum thread contains a Unity package with
an example scene, which can be found
[here](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/68764-LibNoise-Ported-to-Unity).  Please note that LibNoise.Unity is only a repository for the library code itself and
contains no example files. 

[You can also see the converted tutorials examples on this repository](https://github.com/ricardojmendez/LibNoiseTutorials).

Other contributors to LibNoise.Unity include
[Teddy Bradford](https://github.com/teddybradford) who reworked much of the
Noise2D class to improve tiling support for noise maps.
